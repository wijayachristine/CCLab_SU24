                <p>Financioflu Nyctobion</p>

                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Christine Wijaya when interning at the New York Stock Exchange and was told to clean the basement</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Resembles the offices in the NYSE trading floor. They have layers of changing color due to how they came to be.  </p>

                It is a dynamic and influential entity found during the 2008 financial crisis that resides in the NYSE. It feeds on financial transactions thus affecting market behaviors. This creature has a shimmering body that constantly shift colors refelcting the data it is consuming. It thrives in high-activity zones and sleeps during low transaction times. The creature's discovery changes the way we understand the stock market and the finance industry. Scientists speculate there are more of its' family residing in our digital space in different industries that has been affecting the digital space since it was first created. 
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature?</span> It is tough for humans to interact with the creature due to the nature of what it needs. We can sometimes see them exploring the New York Stock Exchange building, especially the trading floor, but not for a long time as they have to go back to their digital space to feed. If they do not feed, they will lose their shimmering shifting colors and crystalize into a black obsidian. But we have to watch out for mutations in the future.
